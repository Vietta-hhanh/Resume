I remember not for nothing the fifth day of November and the plot of gunpowder. Centuries have passed, but the grief and longing will always remain with me.
Who was this man? I know the conspirator's name was guy Fawkes, and he tried to blow up Parliament in 1605.
But who was he really?! What was he like?! We are taught to remember not a person, but an idea. For man is weak.


He may be caught, he may be killed, and he may be forgotten. But even 400 years later, the idea can change the mise EN scene.
I know from personal experience what the power of an idea is. I've seen people commit murder in the name of an idea, people go to their deaths.
But you can't kiss an idea, you can't touch it, you can't hug it. An idea can't bleed out.
She doesn't feel any pain. An idea doesn't know how to love. So it is not the idea that causes my grief, but the person.
Because of him, I remember November 5th. I'll never forget him.
